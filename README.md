# Goldbach Vibes

Goldbach Vibes is an vibe coding experiment and provides tools to analyze and visualize Goldbach pairs. Basically everything you find here is written by an agent, including the sentence you are reading right now.

## Goldbach Conjecture

The Goldbach Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For example:

- 10: 2 Goldbach pairs
  - 10 = 3 + 7
  - 10 = 5 + 5
- 12: 1 Goldbach pair
  - 12 = 5 + 7

## Visualizations

### Goldbach Pair Counts

```bash
python examples/plot/goldbach_pair_counts_plot.py --start 6 --end 50
```

### Goldbach Pair Prime Gaps

Goldbach pair prime gaps visualize the difference between the two primes (q - p) in each Goldbach pair (p,q) for even numbers in a given range.

```bash
python examples/plot/goldbach_pair_prime_gaps_plot.py --start 6 --end 50 
```

### Prime Frequencies in Goldbach Pairs

Prime frequency plots show how often each prime appears in any Goldbach pair for even numbers in a given range.

```bash
python examples/plot/prime_frequency_numberline_plot.py --start 6 --end 50
```

### Twin Prime Goldbach Pairs

This analysis examines Goldbach pairs where **both** primes come from the set of twin primes. Twin primes are primes that are part of twin prime pairs: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc. The same twin prime can be used twice (e.g., 5+5=10).

Inspired by [this analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gojd8mTl3Do), this visualization shows how many Goldbach pairs can be formed using only twin primes.

```bash
python examples/plot/twin_prime_goldbach_pairs_plot.py --start 6 --end 100
```

#### Twin Prime Goldbach Exceptions

There are exactly 35 even numbers that cannot be expressed as the sum of two twin primes, with the largest being 4208. You can find these exceptions using:

```bash
python examples/print/twin_prime_exceptions_print.py --start 2 --end 5000
```

Output:
```
Twin Prime Goldbach Exceptions for range [2, 5000]:

Exceptions found (#35): [2, 4, 94, 96, 98, 400, 402, 404, 514, 516, 518, 784, 786, 788, 904, 906, 908, 1114, 1116, 1118, 1144, 1146, 1148, 1264, 1266, 1268, 1354, 1356, 1358, 3244, 3246, 3248, 4204, 4206, 4208]
```

### Goldbach Pairs and Twin Prime inheritence 

**Twin primes** Pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2, such as (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), etc.

**Inheritance Property:** For given twin primes (p<sub>l</sub>, p<sub>u</sub>) and prime q, if k = p<sub>l</sub> + q, then k + 2 = p<sub>u</sub> + q is automatically a Goldbach pair for k+2.

**Example:** 16 = 11 + 5 implies 18 = 13 + 5 (using twin primes 11, 13).

**Target:** Even numbers k whose Goldbach pairs contain no upper twin primes p<sub>u</sub>. Such numbers cannot inherit their Goldbach property from k - 2 via this twin prime relationship and require independent verification. Let's call this number critical even numbers. 

```bash
python examples/plot/upper_twin_primes_count_plot.py --start 6 --end 50
```

### Critical Even Numbers Density

Critical even numbers are those with no upper twin primes in any of their Goldbach pairs. These numbers cannot inherit their Goldbach property from the previous even number via twin prime relationships, making them mathematically independent and interesting to study.

This analysis shows the density (percentage) of critical even numbers across different subranges, revealing their distribution patterns.

```bash
python examples/plot/critical_density_plot.py --start 6 --end 500 --subrange-size 50
```
